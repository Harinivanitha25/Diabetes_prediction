# Diabetes_prediction

The objective is to develop a predictive model using the Decision Tree algorithm to determine the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on specific health parameters and demographic information. 
•	Data Source: The dataset commonly used for this kind of project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information about female patients of Pima Indian heritage.
•	Features: The dataset includes features such as:
	Number of pregnancies,
	Plasma glucose concentration,
	Diastolic blood pressure,
	Triceps skinfold thickness,
	2-hour serum insulin,
	Body mass index (BMI),
	Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history),
 	Age,
•	Target Variable: The outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic).
